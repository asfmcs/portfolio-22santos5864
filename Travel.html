   <p class="rising-sun">Known as the <strong>‘Land of the Rising Sun’</strong>, Japan is an ecentric mix of past, present, and future, combining ancient samurai traditions and an impressive history with a modern-day persona and new world technology. The country is unique in that, until the late 19th century, it was ruled by the feudal Shogunate, with its semi-divine Emperor a powerless figurehead trapped in the Imperial Palace in the ancient city of <em>Kyoto</em>.Domestic tourism remains a vital part of the Japanese economy and Japanese culture. Children in many middle schools see the highlight of their years as a visit to Tokyo Disneyland or perhaps Tokyo Tower, and many high school students often visit Okinawa or Hokkaido. The extensive rail network together with domestic flights sometimes in planes with modifications to favor the relatively short distances involved in intra-Japan travel allows efficient and speedy transport. <br>
   In inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 28th in the world in 2007. In 2009, the Yomiuri Shimbun published a modern list of famous sights under the name Heisei Hyakkei (the Hundred Views of the Heisei period).Neighbouring South Korea is Japan's most important source of foreign tourists. In 2010, the 2.4 million arrivals made up 27% of the tourists visiting Japan.[5]Chinese travelers are the highest spenders in Japan by country, spending an estimated 196.4 billion yen (US$2.4 billion) in 2011, or almost a quarter of total expenditure by foreign visitors, according to data from the Japan Tourism Agency.[6]The Japanese government hopes to receive 40 million foreign tourists every year by 2020.[7]</p> </center>

<p class="rising-sun">Shinjuku, on the western edge, at roughly '9 o'clock', of the Yamanote Line, is truly a city unto itself, and is designated one of Tokyo's seven sub-metropolitan centers, or fukutoshin. First and foremost, Shinjuku means shopping, eating, and partying. Shinjuku has several huge department stores, music stores, electronics stores, and hundreds and hundreds of bars and restaurants catering to every taste imaginable.injuku is divided into Higashi (east) and Nishi (west) Shinjuku by the train lines that run through Shinjuku Station. Nishi Shinjuku in particular exudes wealth and power with its towering skyscrapers. One of the most eyecatching is Kenzo Tange's inspired citadel, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Buildings, or 'Tocho', daily home to 13,000 Tokyo bureaucrats. Other notable buildings in the Shinjuku area are the tapered and honeycombed Mode Gakuen building (by Tange Associates, the architectural firm headed by Kenzo Tange's son), and the 54-storey Tokyo Opera City with its hi-tech NTT Intercommunication Center, a venue for futuristic exhibitions and events. Higashi Shinjuku, on the other hand, retains the district's original downtown shitamachi roots. This atmosphere is summed up in Shinjuku's three most well-known entertainment districts: Kabukicho, Shinjuku Ni-chome, and the odd little enclave known as the 'Golden Gai.' Omoide Yokocho, like Goldengai, is another district of narrow alleys, though crammed with izakaya-style eateries.</p>

          Located in the Kansai region of Japan, Kyoto is the country's seventh largest city, with a population of 1.4 million people.  Steeped in history, Kyoto is home to roughly one quarter of Japan's national treasures, countless shrines and temples, and seventeen sites recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Travelers to Kyoto can easily spend a week visiting the city's historical attractions such as the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion), and Sanjusangendo.  All sections of the city contain more than one locale well worth a thorough visit,  Notably, some of Japan's oldest traditions, such as the tea ceremony, flower arranging, and geisha schooling originated in the city.  These ancient customs, while still practiced throughout Japan, can only be observed in their original setting in Kyoto.

<em>Japan's capital city</em> and the <strong>emperor's residence</strong> 794 to 1868, Kyoto is known throughout the world for its stunning beauty.  Tourists are drawn year-round by the majestic palaces, statues, and villas, as well as by the carefully tended gardens; each spring, dozens of varieties of cherry trees bloom in Kyoto, and visitors are treated to time-honored hanami (blossom viewing) parties.
Kyoto is dedicated to preserving Japan's oldest traditions, yet it is also a dynamic, contemporary city.  Modern conveniences are readily available, making Kyoto a perfect destination for visitors looking to explore Japan's past without sacrificing the comforts of today.  Known as a national dining mecca, Kyoto proudly offers traditional Japanese cuisines, such as sushi, tofu and obanzi (Kyoto home-style fare).  In addition, a variety of restaurants serve everything from Korean barbecue to French cuisine.  Shopping is also a unique experience in Kyoto, with merchandise ranging from traditional Japanese crafts made by local artisans to cutting-edge couture.  Among Japan's many assets, Kyoto is one of the most prized, comparable only to the world's most dazzling places.
<h2> Osaka

<strong> OSAKA </strong>(about 330 miles southwest of Tokyo) is the second largest city in Japan and the 13th largest city in the world, with a population of about 10.5 million people. Situated on a sheltered bay, it is also the commercial, shipping and industrial center of western Japan, the second major gateway to Japan after Tokyo and the transportation and communication hub of the Kansai region, with a convenient connections to Kyoto, Nara, and Kobe, the Inland Sea area, and Shikoku, which are all nearby. Even though Osaka is flat as flat can be its name means “big hill." Foreign guide books usually do not have much nice to say about Osaka. One said its biggest claims to fame were the yakuza and pachinko. Another called the “Elephant Man” of Japan---ugly but wanting desperately to be loved. Osaka made not be as well-known, rich and flashy as Tokyo but Osakans will tell you that it is a more real, honest, friendly and earthy place with a deeper history and a richer sense of humor and fun. Many say it is the heart of Japan. The people may be a little crude, inconsiderate and pushy at times, yes, but they are also more warm, open and generous. Many of Japan's funniest comedians are from Osaka. Osaka isn't a very attractive place. Sometimes it seems like an endless concrete jungle of crowded streets and sidewalks, train lines, factories, office buildings, pre-fab homes and apartments squeezed much too close together. There isn't all that much to see either. The main tourist sights include a concrete castle, an ultra-modern aquarium with a whale shark and the first Universal Studio to open up outside the United States.

Kobe, capital of Hyogo prefecture, S Honshu, Japan, on Osaka Bay. One of the leading Japanese ports, it is also a major industrial center and railway hub. It is part of a transportation network, which includes express trains and highways, that links it to Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya. It has shipbuilding yards, vehicle factories, iron and steel mills, sugar refineries, and chemical, rubber, and food-processing plants. A cultural center, Kobe has several colleges and universities and many temples and shrines. Since 1878 the city has included Hyogo (formerly Hiogo), an ancient port that was prominent during the Ashikaga period (14th–16th cent.) and regained importance after it was reopened to foreign trade in 1868. Kobe was heavily bombed during World War II but was rebuilt and enlarged, with much commercial building taking place on landfill in Osaka Bay. In Jan., 1995, Kobe suffered a devastating earthquake that killed more than 6,400 people. Much of the port was destroyed; total damages were estimated at over $100 billion.
