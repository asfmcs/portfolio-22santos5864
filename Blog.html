<h4 id="HTML"> What I've Learned of HTML </h4>
<p id="HTML"> 
During these few weeks of Computers 9 honors, we were introduced to HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). By going at our own pace with Khan Academy, we have been able to learn the basics of HTML. When we first started HTML I felt a little bit intimidated because it seemed very complicated; however, when we started with the introduction of Head, body etc. I felt like I really understood. As time passed by I started to feel more confident with the language and the key to it. I learned that not because something seems complicated it is.

We learned to do many things with HTML, by learning in Khan Academy how to write paragraphs, images, tables etc. I was able to do projects like a Travel website, a cookbook, and this website. It has been really fun to learn the Basics of HTML and doing it at our own pace helps us work more efficiently. It is really funny how inside the basics of HTML that we already learned, it sums up almost all of the language. There are of course more complicated things like alignment and crucial formats but with the basics, we have learned we can do a lot of things. HTML even if it looks very intimidating it is actually pretty easy.

<h4> What I've Learned of CSS </h4>

Again, when we first started CSS, it looked like it would be very challenging, however, it was pretty fun. After looking at the Khan Academy videos, I was really amazed by how a site with the same HTML can change so much by just modifying the CSS. It was really fun to follow the Khan Academy videos on how to modify my website. Once that Iearned the basics, it was pretty easy to go online and find different ways to make my site unique.

Somethings that I learned to do in CSS include, text color, fonts, backgrounds, and alignments. With all of these resources and information, I was able to make my own websites different from other people. Even if we all had the same HTML I would be able to make my website very unique due to these tools of HTML. Once that Iearned the basics, it was pretty easy to go online and find a different way to make my site unique. CSS was way easier than I expected and I hope I can learn how to use it better in the future.
